Hi Guys.
I did a Core placement on NOC (Network On Chip) as my Mtech Thesis during 2013 
from BPUT (Biju Patnaik University of Technology) Collecge of Engineering and Techlonogy,
Bhubaneswar.

My actual thesis work used Genetic algorithm and it produced results comparable to 
results published by papers in IEEE.
You can search for Dr.PK Sahu Etal for papers and results.

This Project
++++++++++++
This is though not part of my Published thesis, but my original work of 2013.
it uses some mapping algorithms. see the map_noc.c file for different mapping 
algorithms i have tried. this code is very fast in compared to other test 
results i have came across.
I kept it as to publish if i do PhD, but time didnot permit me. Hence making it 
public in the hope it will be helpful to others.

The datasets are taken from several sources and modified for my own use.
Please see My guide Dr. PK Sahu's publication for results and time comparison.
